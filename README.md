# Nobel Prize Analysis 

This Jupyter notebook explores the open dataset of Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2016 to uncover insights related to demographics, trends, and statistics.

## Data

The dataset contains details on over 900 prize winners including name, category, year awarded, country of birth, age, motivation, and more. It originates from the Nobel Foundation API.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on:

- Determining most common winner demographics like gender, country, and age
- Visualizing award share over time by country and gender
- Identifying repeat winners and youngest/oldest winners 
- Comparing award age differences across prize categories
- Mapping global distribution of winners over time

## Tools 

The analysis utilizes Python and libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

## Key Insights

- Physics, Medicine, Chemistry account for majority of prizes
- Winners are overwhelmingly male, especially in Physics, Chemistry, Economics
- USA dominates recipient country starting in 1930s
- Repeat winners are rare, with some winning twice in similar categories 
- Winner age has increased over time, except for Peace Prize

## Next Steps

Potential extensions could include correlation analysis, prediction modeling, social network analysis of winners, and more advanced visualizations.

Let me know if you would like me to modify or extend this README file further. I can add more details on the analysis, results, and contents of the notebook.
